cringing at everything is cringe. craving a sense of superiority is for the stupid. superiority, like inferiority, is a myth of the capitalistic world. and while it's always f*ck capitalism - one's got to survive. one's got to make a living.
do you ever feel like tech meetings are just a series of buzzwords strung together to sound impressive? don’t worry, you’re not alone. let’s help you understand things and often misunderstood tech jargons and give them the clarity (and mockery) they deserve.

1. **synergy:** <br>
what it sounds like: a secret code for summoning corporate wizards.<br>
what it actually means: “hey, if we work together, maybe we’ll finally get this project done.”

2. **disruptive technology:** <br>
what it sounds like: a teenager's excuse for not doing chores—“sorry, mom, my chores are too disruptive!”<br>
what it actually means: “we invented something so cool, it’ll make your current gadgets feel like rotary phones.”

3. **cloud computing:** <br>
what it sounds like: fluffy data floating in the sky, powered by unicorn dreams.<br>
what it actually means: “your files are on someone else’s computer, but don’t worry, it’s super secure. probably.”

4. **big data:** <br>
what it sounds like: a larger-than-life action hero, starring in the next summer blockbuster.<br>
what it actually means: “we have so much data, we don’t even know what to do with it. so, we’ll just call it big.”

5. **blockchain:** <br>
what it sounds like: a chain of blocks? a new minecraft update?<br>
what it actually means: “a digital ledger that’s so complex, even explaining it sounds like a scam.”

6. **ai** (artificial intelligence): <br>
what it sounds like: robots plotting world domination.<br>
what it actually means: “machines that can sort of think, but still get confused by captcha.”

7. **bandwidth:** <br>
what it sounds like: a garage band trying to sound cooler—“yeah, we’ve got great bandwidth!”<br>
what it actually means: “the amount of data you can download while pretending to pay attention in a zoom meeting.”

8. **pivot:** <br>
what it sounds like: a secret dance move.<br>
what it actually means: “our first idea flopped, so we’re trying something else.”

9. **scalable:** <br>
what it sounds like: something you can climb.<br>
what it actually means: “if this thing actually works, we can make a lot more of it without breaking a sweat.”

10. **iot** (internet of things): <br>
what it sounds like: your fridge is texting your toaster.<br>
what it actually means: “every gadget in your house is now online and conspiring to drain your wi-fi.”

reclaiming these tech jargons doesn’t just mean understanding them—it’s about laughing at their absurdity and realizing that behind every buzzword is a simple concept. so next time someone tries to impress you with "next-gen synergy," just smile and nod.
